// String is the dynamic heap string type, like Vec: use it when you need to own or modify your string data.
// str is an immutable sequence of UTF-8 bytes of dynamic length somewhere in memory. Since the size is unknown, one can only handle it behind a pointer. This means that str most commonly2 appears as &str: a reference to some UTF-8 data, normally called a "string slice" or just a "slice".
